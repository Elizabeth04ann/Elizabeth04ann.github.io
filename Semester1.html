<h1> Semester 1 Project</h1>

<p>In my first semester at Hocking College I learned the following three things from HTML/CSS I and JavaScript I </p>

<ol>
  <li> HTML is the frame, JaveScript is the muscles, and CSS is the skin </li>
  <li> HTML stands for Hypertext markup langage and CSS stands for cascading style sheet </li>
  <li> Java and JaveScript are as related as ham and hamburger</li>
</ol>

<p> I also think that W3schools is a great resource to continue to learn more about web development.</p>

<p> The link to the web app we created from <a href = "https://academy.hubspot.com">HubSpot Academy</a> is <a href = "https://sleepy-headland-60912.herokuapp.com/">Web App</a></p>

<h2> Certificate</h2>

<p> I also completed my first certification with HubSpot Academy.  I earned my Social Media certification.  Below is a copy of the certification.</p>
